# BRTA_PowerBI

This project presents a data visualization dashboard developed using Power BI to analyze data from the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA). The objective of the project is to extract actionable insights from BRTA datasets, focusing on vehicle registrations, driving license distributions, and regional patterns across Bangladesh.

Key Features:

District-wise Vehicle Registration Analysis: Highlights regions with the highest and lowest number of vehicle registrations.

Gender and District-based License Distribution: Provides a demographic breakdown of driving license holders across different districts.

Vehicle Type Trends Over Time: Examines the evolution of different vehicle categories across multiple years to identify transportation trends.

Interactive Dashboard Elements: Includes filters and slicers for district, year, and vehicle type, allowing users to explore the data dynamically.

Technologies and Tools Used:

Power BI for dashboard design and interactive visualizations

Microsoft Excel for data preprocessing and formatting

Purpose of the Project:

The project demonstrates how government data can be transformed into meaningful visual representations to support data-driven decision-making. It emphasizes transparency, accessibility, and clarity in presenting transportation-related statistics relevant to the public and policymakers in Bangladesh.

Data Source:
The dataset used in this project was obtained from publicly available BRTA records.
